# Forge paths — ephemeral vs persistent

@trace spec:forge-cache-architecture, spec:forge-cache-dual

## Provenance

This is project-internal architecture; the authority is the Tillandsias spec + source.
- OpenSpec change `forge-cache-architecture` proposal: <https://github.com/8007342/tillandsias/blob/main/openspec/changes/forge-cache-architecture/proposal.md>
- Mount source code: <https://github.com/8007342/tillandsias/blob/main/crates/tillandsias-core/src/container_profile.rs>
- Env var exports: <https://github.com/8007342/tillandsias/blob/main/images/default/lib-common.sh>

## Use when

You're an agent (or human) writing files inside the forge container and need to know **what survives**, **what's gone on next attach**, and **what would leak across projects**. Read this BEFORE doing any I/O the first time you attach.

## The four categories — at a glance

| Category | Forge path | Survives container stop? | Visible to OTHER projects? | Read/Write |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shared cache** | `/nix/store/` | Yes (host-managed) | Yes (all projects share) | **R only** |
| **Per-project cache** | `/home/forge/.cache/tillandsias-project/` | Yes (per-project) | **No** — isolated | RW |
| **Project workspace** | `/home/forge/src/<project>/` | Yes (your git repo) | **No** — isolated | RW |
| **Ephemeral** | `/tmp/`, unmounted home dirs, anything not in the above three | **NO** — gone on stop | n/a | RW |

## Where to write what

### Build artifacts that are expensive to rebuild → per-project cache

Cargo target/, Maven .m2/, Gradle ~/.gradle/, Flutter pub-cache, npm/yarn/pnpm caches, pip wheel cache, Go module cache, uv cache. Per-language env vars are pre-set in the forge to redirect each tool here:

| Tool | Env var | Subdir under per-project cache |
|---|---|---|
| Cargo | `CARGO_HOME`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` | `cargo/`, `cargo/target/` |
| Go | `GOPATH`, `GOMODCACHE` | `go/`, `go/pkg/mod/` |
| Maven | `MAVEN_OPTS` (`-Dmaven.repo.local=...`) | `maven/` |
| Gradle | `GRADLE_USER_HOME` | `gradle/` |
| Flutter / Dart | `PUB_CACHE` | `pub/` |
| npm | `npm_config_cache` | `npm/` |
| Yarn | `YARN_CACHE_FOLDER` | `yarn/` |
| pnpm | `PNPM_HOME` | `pnpm/` |
| uv | `UV_CACHE_DIR` | `uv/` |
| pip | `PIP_CACHE_DIR` | `pip/` |

You don't need to set these — they're exported by `lib-common.sh` at every entrypoint. Just run your tool normally.

### Source code → project workspace

`/home/forge/src/<project>/` is your git repo. Source code, project config (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.), tests, READMEs. This is what `git status` cares about.

### Throwaway scratch → /tmp/

Big intermediate files you don't want to keep, test fixtures generated for one run, anything you'd `rm -rf` at the end of the script anyway. `/tmp/` is the container's own writable layer — gone on container stop.

### Shared deps → don't write directly; let nix do it

`/nix/store/` is read-only from the forge's perspective. If your project needs a system library available to multiple projects (and you want it cached host-wide), declare it in your project's `flake.nix` — the host populates the nix store via `nix build`, and your forge sees the result via the RO mount. See `cheatsheets/runtime/forge-shared-cache-via-nix.md`.

## Anti-patterns the methodology will flag

- **Writing build output to the project workspace** — `target/`, `node_modules/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `.gradle/`, `.dart_tool/` cluttering your git repo. The env vars above redirect this. If a tool doesn't honor its env var, file a `RUNTIME_LIMITATIONS_NNN.md` (see `cheatsheets/runtime/runtime-limitations.md`).
- **Committing downloaded JARs or vendored binaries** — happened in the `../java/` test agent (committed Adoptium JDK + Log4j JAR). The download telemetry will flag any large file written to the project workspace whose source was a network URL with `reason="workspace-anti-pattern"` (see `cheatsheets/runtime/forge-cache-discipline.md` if/when it lands).
- **Writing big files to `/tmp/` and forgetting** — they're gone on next attach but they take space NOW. Free them eagerly in long-running scripts.
- **Trying to `pip install --user`** — `~/.local/` is in the unmounted-home ephemeral category. Use a per-project venv under the project workspace (which redirects to the per-project cache via `PIP_CACHE_DIR`), or use `pipx` for global tools (already pre-installed: ruff, black, mypy, pytest, httpie, uv, poetry).
- **Trying to write to `/nix/store/`** — fails with EROFS. The shared cache is RO from the forge's seat. Add the dep to `flake.nix` instead.

## Common pitfalls

- **Confusing the per-project cache with `~/.cache/`** — `~/.cache/` (i.e. `/home/forge/.cache/`) is mostly NOT bind-mounted; only the specific subdir `tillandsias-project/` IS. Other tools that write to `~/.cache/something-else/` will lose their state on container stop. If you find a tool that needs persistence outside `tillandsias-project/`, file a RUNTIME_LIMITATIONS report.
- **Cross-project leak via `/tmp/`** — `/tmp/` is per-container so cross-project leak via `/tmp` is impossible (different containers, different /tmp). But beware of using `/tmp/` for state you wanted persistent — it's gone.
- **Per-project cache size growth** — nothing GCs `~/.cache/tillandsias/forge-projects/<project>/` automatically. If a project's cache grows huge, you can `rm -rf ~/.cache/tillandsias/forge-projects/<project>/` from the host (no container needs to be running). Treat this as occasional housekeeping, not part of normal flow.
- **Forge user can't see other projects** — by design. If your project needs to reference files in another project's workspace, you're fighting the architecture. Cross-project sharing happens via git (commit + clone) or via nix (publish a flake).

## Verification

```bash
# Inside any forge container, confirm the four mounts are correctly set up:
mount | grep -E '(nix/store|tillandsias-project|src/)'

# Confirm env vars resolve into per-project cache:
printenv | rg -i '(cache|home|target|gradle|cargo)' | sort

# Quick check that cargo writes to the right place:
cd /home/forge/src/<project>
cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq .target_directory
# expect: /home/forge/.cache/tillandsias-project/cargo/target
```
