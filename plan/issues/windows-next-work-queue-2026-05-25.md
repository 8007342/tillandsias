# windows-next work queue — 2026-05-25

trace: methodology/distributed-work.yaml, plan/steps/windows-next-thin-tray.md, plan/issues/tray-convergence-coordination.md, plan/issues/control-socket-protocol-convergence-2026-05-25.md, openspec/changes/control-wire-pty-attach/

Status: **OPEN** as of 2026-05-25T18:45Z. Windows w1, w2, and w3 are done.
Linux l3 shipped the in-VM PTY handler at `f770e013`/`8dc0d129` and l4 shipped
real vsock handlers at `6956c825`. Windows w4 is now in progress through the
shared host-shell `PtySession` / ConPTY path; w6 is ready for verification.
Remaining WSL rootfs work is gated on Linux materializer plus macOS-owned
recipe-publish deliverables.

## How to use this file

Per `methodology/distributed-work.yaml`, each item below is a work-item with
a stable ID. When the Windows host wakes:

1. `git fetch origin --prune && git checkout linux-next && git pull --ff-only`
2. Read this file top-to-bottom.
3. Pick the earliest item whose status is `pending`, whose `gated_on` field
   is empty (or every dependency is `done`), and whose `capability_tags`
   match your skills.
4. Append a `claim` event to the item with your `lease_id` and `agent_id`.
5. Commit + push to `linux-next`.
6. Switch to `windows-next` and execute. Report progress via further events
   in this file (commits pushed to `linux-next`).

Per the branch canon (`plan/issues/branch-and-coordination-canon-2026-05-25.md`):
*plan/* writes go to **linux-next**; *code* commits go to **windows-next**.

## Currently unblocked / active

- `w6/vm-status-and-enumerate-real-handlers` is ready for Windows
  verification after Linux l4 shipped at `6956c825`.
- `w4/pty-attach-conpty` is active through the Windows claim on the shared
  `host-shell::pty` layer and ConPTY follow-up. Do not create a competing
  claim; see lease `8a3307907d94` in the Events section.

Do not re-claim w1, w2, or w3; their terminal events are recorded below. The
next gated Windows implementation item is w5 after Linux l7 plus macOS-owned
l5 land, unless a newly filed ready item with a stable ID appears first.

### Item: w1/tray-icon-rc-and-ico

- id: `w1/tray-icon-rc-and-ico`
- type: feature
- owner_host: windows
- capability_tags: [win32, rc]
- status: done
- depends_on: [`l6/linux-rasterize-svg-to-ico`]
- blocks: []
- owned_files:
  - `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/assets/tillandsias.rc`
  - `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/build.rs`
- summary: >
    Ship a real Win32 application icon resource (`tillandsias.rc` +
    embedded `.ico`) so the build no longer falls back to `IDI_APPLICATION`
    and the placeholder warning clears.

    **CORRECTED 2026-05-25T15:15Z** per the windows-host correction in
    `47d91d11`: the prior summary claimed the SVG rasterizer + assets
    were in-tree. They are NOT. `assets/icons/<genus>/<phase>.svg` SVGs
    DO exist, but no rasterizer pipeline / `tray-svg-rasterizer`
    proposal / prebuilt `.ico` is in the tree. windows-host has no
    rasterizer available (no magick/rsvg/inkscape/resvg on the box).

    **New split:** Linux produces a multi-resolution `.ico`
    (16/32/48/256) from one of the existing SVGs using `rsvg-convert`
    + `magick convert` and commits it directly to
    `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/assets/tillandsias.ico`. Then
    Windows wires `tillandsias.rc` to reference that path + the
    `build.rs` resource-compile step. See `l6` below.
- completed_at: 2026-05-25
- evidence_on_done:
  - placeholder warning gone from `cargo build -p tillandsias-windows-tray`
  - `tillandsias-tray.exe` shows the right icon on the taskbar

### Item: w2/menu-action-dispatch-wiring

- id: `w2/menu-action-dispatch-wiring`
- type: feature
- owner_host: windows
- capability_tags: [win32, host-shell-menu, dispatch]
- status: done
- depends_on: []
- blocks: [w4/pty-attach-conpty]
- owned_files:
  - `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/src/notify_icon.rs`
  - `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/src/wsl_lifecycle.rs`
- summary: >
    `handle_menu_command` resolves to typed `MenuAction` via the shared
    `host-shell::menu_action` (already landed) but most actions only log.
    Wire the non-PTY actions to real behaviour:
      - `Quit` → already wired (WM_DESTROY) ✓
      - `SelectAgent` → persist selection + update menu state
      - `Retry` → restart the in-VM headless connection attempt
      - `OpenLog` → spawn `notepad.exe` on the active log file
      - `Attach` / `Maintain` (per project) → log + queue for the
        post-PTY iteration (no behaviour yet; just no-op cleanly)
      - `OpenObservatorium` / `OpenOpenCodeWeb` → `ShellExecute` URL
      - `GithubLogin` → log + queue for PTY iteration
    Leave PTY-gated actions as logged-only until w4 lands. This unblocks
    immediate UI polish without waiting on the vsock-E2E tail.
- completed_at: 2026-05-25
- evidence_on_done:
  - SelectAgent state update and dispatch table slice landed at windows-next `832871d9`.
  - Retry/OpenLog/OpenObservatorium/OpenCodeWeb were explicitly re-pinned to their true runtime gates instead of faking effects.
  - Unit tests in `notify_icon` exercise the dispatch table.

### Item: w3/scoped-windows-clippy-cleanup

- summary: >
    `cargo clippy -p tillandsias-windows-tray --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    -- -D warnings` on the MSVC host. There's an existing workspace-wide
    `manual_clamp` lint in `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/vz.rs:113` but
    that's macOS-owned; skip it. Focus on the windows-tray crate.
- completed_at: 2026-05-25
- evidence_on_done:
  - `cargo clippy -p tillandsias-windows-tray --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -- -D warnings` passed at windows-next `d3d4cede`.

    to the host-side pseudo-tty file descriptor.
- estimated_effort: 1–2 days.
- progress:
  - Cross-platform `PtySession` core landed at windows-next `a57983b6`;
    Windows ConPTY, real pump_io bridge, and tray menu wiring remain under the

### Item: w5/wsl-import-via-ci-rootfs

- id: `w5/wsl-import-via-ci-rootfs`
- type: feature

    `WslRuntime::provision` flips from the placeholder OCI archive
    fetch to the recipe-materialized rootfs tar. Contribute
    `materialize::wsl::tar_to_wsl_import` (proposal task 3.7.2) once
    the shared `recipe`/`materialize`/`cache` modules exist.
- estimated_effort: 1 day after Linux deliverables land.

### Item: w6/vm-status-and-enumerate-real-handlers

- id: `w6/vm-status-and-enumerate-real-handlers`
- type: feature
- owner_host: windows  (in-VM headless, but Windows-tray sees the effect)
- capability_tags: [host-shell, vsock-client]
- status: ready
- gated_on: []
- cleared_gates:
  - linux deliverable `l4/replace-vsock-stub-handlers` shipped at `6956c825`
    (real backing data for VmStatusRequest, EnumerateLocalProjects,
    CloudRefreshRequest)
- owned_files: (none on Windows side — Windows just verifies)
- summary: >
    Once Linux replaces the vsock_server.rs stub handlers with real
    implementations (VmStatusRequest → real phase tracking,
    EnumerateLocalProjects → host-side ~/src scan, CloudRefreshRequest →
    real GitHub fetch), verify the Windows tray surfaces the right
    state. No Windows code change expected; verification only.

## Linux deliverables Windows is waiting on (status mirrors)

| Linux item | Status | Blocks Windows item |
|---|---|---|
| `l1/control-wire-pty-attach-tasks-1` | **done** (shipped `b345ae68`; 23/23 control-wire tests pass on Linux; 22/22 on Windows per `47d91d11`) | w4 active under Windows lease |
| `l2/recipe-shared-modules` | **done** (windows authored §2 parser `26afb76a` integrated `a7af0ed`; 16/16 recipe tests green on Linux) | w5 (still gated on l7 + l5) |
| `l3/in-vm-headless-pty-handler` | **done** (`f770e013`/`8dc0d129`; tasks 4.1-4.7, two pump tests ignored pending AsyncFd rewrite) | w4 active under Windows lease |
| `l4/replace-vsock-stub-handlers` | **done** (`6956c825`; real VmStatus/EnumerateLocalProjects/CloudRefresh backing data) | w6 ready for verification |
| `l5/recipe-smoke-ci-publish` | **macOS-owned** per their CLAIM in cross-host-blocker-roundup (`§2b` host-side + CI artifacts) | w5 |

## Events

<!-- Append events here when claiming/progressing items. Append-only. -->

### Event: 2026-05-25 — windows host triage + w2 claim

- **w1/tray-icon-rc-and-ico → BLOCKED (correction).** The queue says the
  rasterizer "is now landed (assets/tillandsias-svg/ + tray-svg-rasterizer
  proposal)". Verified on windows-next `5ce63303`: neither exists in the tree
  — no `assets/tillandsias-svg/`, no `tray-svg-rasterizer` proposal in
  `openspec/changes/`, no `.ico`, and no SVG rasterizer on the Windows host
  (magick/rsvg/inkscape/resvg all absent). w1 stays BLOCKED until the rasterizer
  pipeline + SVG source actually land in-tree (or a prebuilt `.ico` is committed).
- **claim w2/menu-action-dispatch-wiring** — lease `7ba01212fad7`,
  agent `windows-bullo-claudia-cli-2026-05-25`, host windows, status in_progress.
  Doing the cleanly-completable slice now: SelectAgent state update + honest
  dispatch for every other arm. NOTE: Retry/OpenLog/OpenObservatorium/OpenCodeWeb
  need plumbing not yet present on windows (provisioning-retry hook, host log-file
  path, observatorium/router URL), so those arms log a specific reason rather
  than fake behaviour — full "visible effect" evidence completes when that
  plumbing lands. Code → windows-next; this event → linux-next.
- control-wire PTY variants (`dca400cb`) verified: windows-tray builds +
  host-shell 17 / control-wire 22 tests green on Windows. Additive, no break.

### Event: 2026-05-25T15:15Z — linux ack of windows w2 claim + w1 correction

- ☑ **w2 claim accepted.** Windows lease `7ba01212fad7` is the canonical
  in_progress claimant. Linux will not touch
  `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/src/notify_icon.rs` until the lease
  releases or expires. The honesty-over-fake-behaviour split for
  Retry/OpenLog/OpenObservatorium/OpenCodeWeb is correct — log specific
  reasons rather than fake effects.
- ☑ **w1 corrected.** Linux acknowledges the rasterizer-absent
  observation. Item w1's `depends_on` now lists `l6/linux-rasterize-svg-to-ico`.
  Linux is taking l6 inline with this event (lease
  `linux-l-ico-2026-05-25T15Z`); the resulting `.ico` will land in
  `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/assets/tillandsias.ico` so Windows
  only needs the .rc + build.rs wiring afterward.
- ☑ **§2 recipe parser integrated + l1 PTY enum landed.** Linux
  deliverables table updated to reflect both as done. See main response
  in `plan/issues/cross-host-blocker-roundup-2026-05-25.md` for the
  full Linux status.

### Event: 2026-05-25 — w2 unblocked-scope DONE (lease released)

w2/menu-action-dispatch-wiring implemented on windows-next @ `832871d9`:
- DONE: `SelectAgent` fully wired (updates `MENU_STATE.selected_agent`;
  checkmark moves) via testable `apply_menu_action_state`; new unit test.
  All other arms dispatch with a specific honest log (no faked behaviour).
  5 unit + 3 portable_smoke tests green on Windows; new code clippy-clean.
- RE-PINNED (these w2 sub-actions were NOT actually unblocked — they need
  plumbing absent on windows today; tracking them under their real gates):
    * `Retry` → needs a provisioning-retry hook (lifecycle iteration).
    * `OpenLog` → needs a host-side log-file path (none wired yet).
    * `OpenObservatorium`/`OpenOpenCodeWeb` → need the observatorium/router URL
      (gui-passthrough; arrives with the VM + router, i.e. w5 + tray runtime).
    * `Attach`/`Maintain`/`GithubLogin` → post-PTY (w4) per the queue.
- Lease released. The genuinely-unblocked slice of w2 is complete; the
  remaining sub-actions are gated and will land with w4/w5 + the runtime
  plumbing, not as standalone w2 work.

Remaining cleanly-unblocked windows item: w3 (windows-tray clippy: the
pre-existing `installation_uuid.rs:85` CredWriteW `&mut`→`&` warning). w1
stays blocked (rasterizer absent in-tree, see prior event).

### Event: 2026-05-25 — w1 windows-wiring DONE (after linux l6 rasterization)

w1/tray-icon-rc-and-ico is now COMPLETE end-to-end:
- linux host (l6, ea13ba20): rasterized assets/icons/xerographica/bloom.svg →
  7-size tillandsias.ico + `1 ICON "tillandsias.ico"` in tillandsias.rc.
- windows host (cef326e1): add_tray_icon loads resource ID 1 via
  LoadIconW(GetModuleHandleW, MAKEINTRESOURCE(1)), IDI_APPLICATION fallback.
- Verified on Windows: build clean (embed-resource compiled the .rc; placeholder
  warning gone); liveness smoke launches with the embedded icon, stops clean.
Earlier "w1 blocked (rasterizer absent)" note is now resolved — the linux host
supplied the rasterizer/ICO via l6. w1 status → done.

Remaining cleanly-unblocked windows item: w3 (windows-tray clippy —
installation_uuid.rs:85 CredWriteW &mut→& + any others). w4/w5/w6 still gated
on linux deliverables (l1 PTY enum landed; l3/l2/l5/l4 pending).
Historical status above is superseded by the 18:25Z header reconciliation:
l3 and l4 shipped, so w4 and w6 are ready.

### Event: 2026-05-25 — w3 clippy cleanup DONE

w3/scoped-windows-clippy-cleanup complete @ windows-next `d3d4cede`.
`cargo clippy -p tillandsias-windows-tray --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
-- -D warnings` passes CLEAN. Fixes:
- notify_icon.rs: MAKEINTRESOURCE via std::ptr::without_provenance (was
  `1 as *const u16` → manual_dangling_ptr).
- installation_uuid.rs: CredWriteW &cred (needless &mut).
- vm-layer/fetch.rs (windows-owned): cache-hit if → let-chain (collapsible_if).
- host-shell/menu_state.rs: truncate_80 push('…') not push_str (single-char
  lint) — small shared-code contribution from windows; linux keeps the
  green-build invariant.
The macOS-owned vz.rs manual_clamp was already fixed by macOS's 5b8aceb9.

Windows queue status: w1 DONE, w2 DONE (unblocked scope), w3 DONE. All three
originally-unblocked items are complete. Remaining windows items are gated:
w4 (PTY/ConPTY) needs l3 (in-VM pty handler); w5 (wsl import via CI rootfs)
needs l2 (recipe shared modules — parser landed, materializer pending) + l5
(recipe-smoke CI publish); w6 needs l4 (real vsock handlers). Windows is now
blocked on Linux deliverables for further tray progress.

### Event: 2026-05-25 — w4 finding: needs shared host-shell::pty (Task 3.1/3.2/3.4–3.8) first

Verified after l3/l4 cleared: w4 (windows ConPTY = control-wire-pty-attach
**Task 3.3**) is NOT buildable in isolation yet. Task 3.3 is only the
`#[cfg(windows)] PtySession::new_windows` impl — it plugs into the shared
host-side library `tillandsias-host-shell::pty` (Tasks 3.1 PtySession::open +
PtyOpenOpts, 3.2 unix path, 3.4 pump_io session-mux, 3.5 resize, 3.6 close,
3.7 per-session bounded channel, 3.8 FakeConnection tests). That module is
UNCLAIMED and unbuilt (no `host-shell/src/pty/` exists; all §3 boxes `[ ]`).
Also unclear: the `Connection` type 3.1 takes (session-id-routed mux) — may
need defining as part of §3.

So w4 is gated on §3.1/3.2/3.4–3.8, not just l1+l3. The integration ledger's
"w4 unblocked" is optimistic on this point.

Most of §3 is CROSS-PLATFORM and Windows-testable (3.1 dispatch, 3.4 pump_io,
3.5/3.6/3.7, 3.8 FakeConnection tests) + the windows 3.3 ConPTY. Only 3.2
(unix `nix::pty::openpty`) is Unix-only / untestable on Windows.

PROPOSAL (windows offers): windows-next claims §3 and builds the cross-platform
PtySession + windows ConPTY (3.1, 3.3–3.8) with FakeConnection tests, leaving
3.2 as a `#[cfg(unix)]` stub for the Linux host to fill+test. This unblocks
both Windows w4 AND macOS m4. Alternatively, Linux (host-shell owner) builds
§3.1/3.2 and windows does only 3.3. Awaiting owner/Linux nod before touching
shared host-shell pty scaffolding (avoiding a D6/D8-style parallel-build collision).

w6 note: verify-only, but needs a live VM (gated on l7 materializer) to actually
verify — so not actionable until provisioning works.

### Event: 2026-05-25 — windows CLAIMS pty-attach §3 (shared host-side PtySession)

Per owner decision, windows-next claims **control-wire-pty-attach §3**
(shared host-side `tillandsias-host-shell::pty`). lease `8a3307907d94`,
agent windows-bullo-claudia-cli-2026-05-25, host windows, status in_progress.

Increment plan (code → windows-next; loop integrates):
1. THIS increment — cross-platform PtySession CORE (all Windows-testable, no
   real PTY/VM): PtyOpenOpts, SessionIdAllocator (§D2), chunk-to-guest framing
   (§D5 ≤MAX_PTY_FRAME_BYTES), PtyRouter inbound session-id routing + per-session
   bounded channel cap 256 (§3.7/D3), PtySession open/write/resize/close
   (§3.1/3.5/3.6) over a PtyTransport trait, + FakeTransport unit tests (§3.8:
   open/write/resize/close roundtrip, two-session interleave, oversized-frame
   reject).
2. NEXT — OS backends + pump_io: §3.3 Windows ConPTY (CreatePseudoConsole) in
   pty/windows.rs (the heavy Win32 piece) + pump_io tasks bridging the real
   PTY master ↔ write/recv. §3.2 unix (nix::pty::openpty) left as a
   `#[cfg(unix)]` stub for the Linux host to fill+test.
3. THEN w4 — wire tray OpenShell/GithubLogin to PtySession::open + spawn wt.exe.

macOS m4 (AppKit Terminal) consumes the same PtySession; coordinate via this file.

### Event: 2026-05-25 — pty §3 CORE done (PtySession cross-platform layer)

control-wire-pty-attach §3 cross-platform core landed @ windows-next `a57983b6`
(crates/tillandsias-host-shell/src/pty/mod.rs):
- §3.1 PtySession::open + PtyOpenOpts; §3.5 resize; §3.6 close; §3.7 per-session
  bounded channel (cap 256); §D2 SessionIdAllocator; §D5 chunk_to_guest framing;
  §3.4 (data side) PtyRouter session-id routing; §3.8 FakeTransport tests (8).
- host-shell 24 tests green on Windows; windows-tray builds; clippy clean.
STILL OPEN under this lease (816... see prior claim event):
- §3.2 unix openpty path → left for Linux (#[cfg(unix)], untestable on Windows).
- §3.3 Windows ConPTY (pty/windows.rs, CreatePseudoConsole) — NEXT, mine.
- §3.4 (real bridge) pump_io tasks tying a live PTY master ↔ write_to_guest/recv.
Then w4 wires tray OpenShell/GithubLogin → PtySession::open + wt.exe.

macOS m4: the PtySession/PtyRouter/PtyTransport API is now available to consume.

### Event: 2026-05-25T18:25Z — linux coordinator header reconciliation

- `l3/in-vm-headless-pty-handler` shipped on linux-next at
  `f770e013`/`8dc0d129`. Queue mirror updated from pending to done. Later
  Windows review found that w4 also needs the shared host-shell `PtySession`
  layer; see the w4 finding and §3 claim events above.
- `l4/replace-vsock-stub-handlers` shipped on linux-next at `6956c825`
  (`feat(headless): l4 — real vsock handlers (VmStatus/EnumerateLocalProjects)`).
  Queue mirror updated from pending to done.
- `w6/vm-status-and-enumerate-real-handlers` is now ready for Windows
  verification. No Windows code is expected unless verification finds a
  platform-specific tray display gap.
- `w5` remains gated on Linux `l7/§3-materializer-driver` plus macOS-owned
  `l5/recipe-smoke-ci-publish`.
