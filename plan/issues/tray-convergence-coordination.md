# Tray convergence coordination (windows-next view) — 2026-05-24

Cold-start note: three native trays (Linux GNOME/KDE, macOS AppKit, Windows
Win32) must converge on shared crates. This file is the windows-next mirror of
the macOS worker's coordination block in `plan/steps/20-macos-tray-v0_0_1.md`
(authored on linux-next). Read both. Keep checkpoints frequent — linux-next
integrates local changes every few hours.

## Shared contracts (do NOT break unilaterally)

- `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/lib.rs` — the `VmRuntime` trait signatures
  are the FROZEN shared contract (macOS worker will not change them; neither
  will windows-next). Snapshot/fast-boot must NOT be bolted onto the trait
  ad hoc — route it through the recipe/cache model or a coordinated trait
  addendum proposal.
- vsock control wire: guest binds `VMADDR_CID_ANY:42420`; host always
  *connects*, never binds. Port 42420 = `CONTROL_WIRE_VSOCK_PORT`. Wire
  protocol (postcard envelope, 4-byte length prefix, Hello/HelloAck) unchanged.
- Versioning (owner, 2026-05-24): all three trays + headless ship under the
  SAME Tillandsias CalVer string, NO `m`/`w`/`v` prefix yet.
  (`artifact-namespace-prefix-versioning` is drafted, non-blocking.)
- Menu UX parity: all trays surface the same host-shell menu model incl.
  `GitHub login` and `Open Shell`, routed via PTY-over-vsock once
  `control-wire-pty-attach` merges.

## File ownership (windows-next side)

- windows-next OWNS (edits aggressively):
  - `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/wsl.rs` (body)
  - `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/**`
  - `scripts/build-windows-tray.*`, `scripts/install-windows.ps1` (new)
- windows-next edits CONSERVATIVELY (additive, coordinate first):
  - `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/lib.rs` — module decls only, never trait sigs
  - `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/Cargo.toml` — additive features/optional deps
  - `crates/tillandsias-control-wire/{lib,transport}.rs` — Windows-cfg `pub use` only
- windows-next will NOT touch:
  - `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/vz.rs`, `crates/tillandsias-macos-tray/**`
  - `crates/tillandsias-control-wire/src/transport_vsock_macos.rs`
- SHARED with macOS (coordinate before edits): the planned
  `crates/tillandsias-vm-layer/src/{recipe,materialize,cache}.rs` modules from
  `vm-recipe-provisioning`. macOS worker explicitly expects to share these
  with the Windows builder. The Windows-specific converter is
  `materialize::wsl::tar_to_wsl_import` (proposal task 3.7.2).

## CONVERGENCE CONFLICT found 2026-05-24 (needs owner steer)

windows-next Phase 2 (commit c43390b4) implemented the **binary-download**
provisioning path per the CURRENT active `vm-provisioning-lifecycle` spec:
- `tillandsias-vm-layer::fetch` (download_verified + SHA-256 + resume),
- `crates/tillandsias-windows-tray/assets/provisioning-manifest.json` pinning
  `tillandsias-linux-x86_64` @ v0.2.260523.6 + the Fedora 44 OCI base.

But the in-flight proposal `openspec/changes/vm-recipe-provisioning/`
(owner stance, created 2026-05-24, NOT yet started/merged) is **BREAKING**
against that path:
- "Tillandsias does not ship any Linux binaries." The release pipeline drops
  the `tillandsias-linux-*` asset.
- The host materializes the in-VM rootfs locally from `images/vm/Recipefile`
  via shared `recipe`/`materialize`/`cache` modules; output is a rootfs `.tar`
  that `materialize::wsl::tar_to_wsl_import` feeds to `wsl --import`.

Implication: my Phase 2 download path + the OCI-flatten I had planned for
Phase 2b are superseded by the recipe model. The Windows-OWNED piece survives
intact: `WslRuntime::provision` (wsl --import + wsl.conf + systemd unit +
terminate) is needed in BOTH models — both end in a rootfs `.tar`.

## Convergence decision (windows-next)

1. Treat `fetch.rs` as a generic, still-useful utility (verified/resumable
   download), NOT the primary provisioning path. The recipe materializer may
   reuse it for base-image/layer fetches; otherwise it stays feature-gated and
   harmless. Do NOT delete (tested, behind `download` feature).
2. Mark `provisioning-manifest.json`'s binary pin as INTERIM (matches today's
   active spec; superseded once `vm-recipe-provisioning` syncs into the spec).
3. Do NOT build the Phase 2b OCI-flatten — the recipe materializer exports a
   flat rootfs `.tar` directly, so flatten is wasted under the recipe model.
4. Snapshot/fast-boot (was Phase 3) converges with the recipe `cache` model:
   the "golden base" is the cached materialized rootfs; per-launch fast clone
   stays a Windows-owned `wsl --import-in-place` of a VHDX/tar copy in `wsl.rs`.
5. Advance model-INDEPENDENT work next: Phase 4 (tray actions + vsock E2E via
   host-shell + control-wire-pty-attach) converges with macOS through shared
   crates and is unblocked regardless of provisioning model.

## Open question for owner / cross-host

- Who drives the shared `vm-recipe-provisioning` (recipe/materialize/cache)?
  macOS worker is heads-down on the VzRuntime vsock spike (~3 days) and hasn't
  started it. windows-next can contribute `materialize::wsl::tar_to_wsl_import`
  + drive the parser/cache, but materialization on a Windows host needs
  buildah/podman inside WSL (the host has no native buildah) — a wrinkle the
  proposal's "throwaway container" step should address for Windows.
- Interim: keep the windows-next download path alive ONLY to reach a bootable
  VM + vsock handshake for validating Windows-specific code, clearly flagged
  superseded? Or pause provisioning and pivot straight to Phase 4?
