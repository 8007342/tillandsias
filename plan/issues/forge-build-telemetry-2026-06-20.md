## Current State

The forge build has **two independent telemetry backends** that are not converged:

### Shell path (`scripts/build-image.sh`)
- Measures **total** `duration_s` and `size_bytes` per image
- Records to `$HOME/.cache/tillandsias/telemetry/build-metrics.jsonl` (5-field JSONL: timestamp, image, duration_s, size_bytes, hash)
- Does NOT measure per-install-step durations, per-artifact download sizes, or individual RUN-layer cost

### Rust path (`tillandsias --init` via `crates/tillandsias-headless/src/main.rs`)
- Richer `ImageBuildEvent` schema with 20+ fields (schema_version, duration_ms, image_size_bytes, bytes_downloaded, cache_policy, etc.)
- Records to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tillandsias/image-build-events.jsonl`
- Only used by the `--init` flow; shell workflow uses its own minimal format

### Existing hooks
- `build-image.sh` already saves full build log to `$ROOT/build-${IMAGE_NAME}.log`
- `build-image.sh` already computes source content hash and checks staleness
- Podman 5.8+ supports `--progress json` which emits per-step timing and download progress
- `scripts/generate-dashboard.sh` already exists but only consumes the minimal JSONL

## Gap Analysis

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| Total build duration per image | ✅ captured |
| Final image size | ✅ captured |
| Per-RUN-layer duration | ❌ not captured |
| Per-artifact download size | ❌ not captured |
| Per-step podman cache decisions | ❌ not captured |
| Per-tool install time (dnf, npm, pip, curl, tar) | ❌ not captured |
| Total bytes downloaded per build | ❌ not captured |
| Unified telemetry schema (shell + Rust converge) | ❌ two separate sinks |
| Dev environment analysis dashboard | ⚠️ partial (`generate-dashboard.sh` exists, minimal) |
| Historical trend tracking | ❌ no retention/prometheus-style metrics |

## Proposed Instrumentation Plan

### Slice 1: Per-step timing via Podman JSON progress

Podman 5.8+ `--progress json` outputs structured build events including per-step:
- `step_duration_ms`
- `download_size_bytes` (for each pull/copy/download step)
- `cache_hit` / `cache_miss` per layer

Implementation:
1. Add `--progress json` flag to the `podman build` invocation in `scripts/build-image.sh`
2. Pipe the JSON progress output to a log file alongside the existing build log
3. Parse the JSON event stream after the build to extract:
   - Total wall-clock time per step
   - Download byte counts per artifact
   - Cache decision per layer
4. Append structured metrics to the telemetry JSONL

### Slice 2: Converge shell and Rust telemetry backends

1. Align the shell path's JSONL schema with `ImageBuildEvent` fields (add `duration_ms`, `bytes_downloaded`, `cache_result`, `decision`, `reason`)
2. Have both paths write to the same `image-build-events.jsonl` location (under `$XDG_STATE_HOME` where the Rust path already writes)
3. Cross-reference: add build-identity tag so shell-initiated and rust-initiated builds can be distinguished

### Slice 3: Dev environment analysis tooling

1. Extend `scripts/generate-dashboard.sh` to consume the richer JSONL schema
2. Produce a per-build summary table: total time, download size, cache-hit ratio, per-image breakdown
3. Add a CLI command (or script) to compare N most recent builds for regression detection
4. Save output to `$HOME/.cache/tillandsias/telemetry/` for operator review

## Architectural Note (for Tlatoani)

- The `--progress json` approach gives us all download-size data for free with zero Containerfile changes
- Per-install-step duration inside the container requires either: (a) wrapping each RUN in `time` and capturing to a build manifest file, or (b) using buildkit's `--output` mounts to write timing data out of the container
- Option (a) is simpler: wrap each heavy RUN layer in `time <command> && echo "<LABEL>: $SECONDS" >> /tmp/build-manifest`, then `podman run --rm <image> cat /tmp/build-manifest` to extract
- For initial implementation, Slice 1 (Podman JSON progress) covers 80% of the requirement with 10% of the effort
- The two-backend convergence (Slice 2) should happen before adding new dashboards (Slice 3) to avoid building on the wrong schema

## Acceptance Evidence

- `scripts/build-image.sh forge` emits per-step timing and download-size metrics to telemetry JSONL
- Metrics include at minimum: duration_ms, bytes_downloaded, cache_result per layer or per image
- `scripts/generate-dashboard.sh` (or successor) renders a human-readable summary from the enriched JSONL
- Shell path and Rust path write to the same telemetry sink with compatible schema
- No regression in build speed or correctness; all existing E2E gates pass
