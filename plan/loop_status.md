# Multi-Host Coordination Loop Status

LastExecutionTime: 2026-06-20T09:00Z

## This Loop (2026-06-20T09:00Z, linux)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration E2E gate on mutable Linux.
- **Startup**: clean mutable-Linux host on `linux-next`; fetched origin and confirmed local branch was aligned with `origin/linux-next@36980e42`.
- **Sibling heads after startup fetch**:
  - `main`: `6dfafdf1`.
  - `linux-next`: `36980e42`.
  - `windows-next`: `a3c8b23d`.
  - `osx-next`: `d829808d`.
- **E2E gates**: Ran local-build E2E via `/build-install-and-smoke-test-e2e`. Build and install succeeded (`build_install_exit=0`), and destructive Podman reset succeeded (`reset_exit=0`). However, the re-provisioning step (`tillandsias --init --debug`) failed (`init_exit=1`) because `wasmtime` is missing from the minimal-44 dnf repositories.
- **New findings**: Filed `local-smoke/wasmtime-dnf-migration-failure` in `plan/issues/build-install-smoke-e2e-findings-2026-06-20.md`.
- **Blockers**: Added `local-smoke/wasmtime-dnf-migration-failure` as an active blocker for the Linux E2E gate.

## This Loop (2026-06-20T07:49Z, linux)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration worker drain on mutable Linux.
- **Startup**: clean mutable-Linux host on `linux-next`; fetched origin and
  confirmed local branch was aligned with `origin/linux-next@c3c7af60`, then
  pushed claim commit `22e5987a`.
- **Sibling heads after startup fetch**:
  - `main`: `6dfafdf1`.
  - `linux-next`: `c3c7af60` at worker selection, then `8fe56fb9` after the
    implementation commit.
  - `windows-next`: `a3c8b23d` (ancestor of linux-next at post-push audit).
  - `osx-next`: `d829808d` (ancestor of linux-next at post-push audit).
- **Worker drain**: completed `policy/no-python-litmus-drift`. Added
  `tillandsias-policy` helpers for JSON string extraction, menu parity
  assertions, disabled-with-v2 menu assertions, and Vault unsealed timestamp
  parsing; extended `check-no-python-scripts` to scan litmus YAML; replaced the
  remaining active litmus Python snippets with Rust-backed helpers or
  POSIX shell/openssl equivalents.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p tillandsias-policy` PASS; five touched
  litmus YAML files validate; policy no-Python checker PASS; shell wrapper
  PASS; helper smoke checks PASS; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` PASS;
  `git diff --check` PASS; active litmus Python scan found no matches;
  `./build.sh --check` PASS with only the known unrelated dev-proxy warning.
- **Integration/runtime**: post-push coordination re-fetched origin at
  2026-06-20T07:59Z. `origin/windows-next` and `origin/osx-next` are both
  ancestors of `origin/linux-next@8fe56fb9` (drift: windows 0 ahead / linux 21
  ahead; osx 0 ahead / linux 20 ahead). No merge or freeze required.
- **Release/e2e freshness**: latest published GitHub release remains
  `v0.3.260618.2` at `6dfafdf1`, published 2026-06-18T18:07:14Z; existing
  curl-install smoke evidence for that release is current.
- **E2E gates**: destructive local-build/curl-install gates not run for this
  policy/litmus-only worker slice; no shipped runtime or release artifact delta.
- **New findings**: none.

## This Loop (2026-06-20T07:38Z, linux)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration worker drain on mutable Linux.
- **Startup**: clean mutable-Linux host on `linux-next`; fetched origin,
  fast-forwarded from `d697f866` to `b2b37d10`, then pushed claim commit
  `4c15fc72`.
- **Sibling heads after startup fetch**:
  - `main`: `6dfafdf1`.
  - `linux-next`: `b2b37d10` at worker selection, then `4c15fc72` after the
    claim commit.
  - `windows-next`: `a3c8b23d` (ancestor of linux-next at fetch).
  - `osx-next`: `d829808d` (ancestor of linux-next at fetch).
- **Worker drain**: completed
  `forge-diagnostics/e2e-piggyback-orchestration` no-Python diagnostics litmus
  drift. Added `tillandsias-policy validate-forge-diagnostics-json`, made it
  tolerate forge banner/fenced JSON logs via the distiller's brace-extraction
  contract, replaced the diagnostics litmus's inline `python3 -c` validator,
  and excluded `.stderr.log` companions from the stdout JSON selector.
- **Verification**: `cargo test -p tillandsias-policy` PASS; edited litmus YAML
  validates; validator passes against
  `target/forge-diagnostics/diagnostics_20260619T234257Z.log`; no-Python script
  checker PASS; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` PASS; `git diff --check` PASS;
  `./build.sh --check` PASS.
- **Integration/runtime**: post-push coordination re-fetched origin at
  2026-06-20T07:42Z. `origin/windows-next` and `origin/osx-next` are both
  ancestors of `origin/linux-next@30e014dc` (drift: windows 0 ahead / linux 18
  ahead; osx 0 ahead / linux 17 ahead). No merge or freeze required.
- **Release/e2e freshness**: latest published GitHub release remains
  `v0.3.260618.2` at `6dfafdf1`, published 2026-06-18T18:07:14Z; existing
  curl-install smoke evidence for that release is current.
- **E2E gates**: destructive local-build/curl-install gates not run for this
  policy/litmus-only worker slice; no shipped runtime or release artifact delta.
- **New findings**: filed `policy/no-python-litmus-drift` for remaining
  `python3` command fields in non-diagnostics litmus YAML.

## Progress Since Last Loop

- **policy/no-python-litmus-drift**: COMPLETED; no active litmus YAML command
  fields shell out to Python, and the no-Python checker now scans litmus YAML.
- **forge-diagnostics/e2e-piggyback-orchestration**: COMPLETED no-Python
  diagnostics litmus drift slice; Rust validator now owns diagnostics JSON
  validation.

## This Loop (2026-06-20T07:20Z, linux)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration worker drain on mutable Linux.
- **Startup**: clean mutable-Linux host on `linux-next`; fetched origin, in sync with `origin/linux-next` at `36cd9020`.
- **Sibling heads after fetch**:
  - `main`: `6dfafdf1` (tagged `v0.3.260618.2`).
  - `linux-next`: `36cd9020`
  - `windows-next`: `e332afb6` (ancestor of linux-next, 0 ahead).
  - `osx-next`: `c7d32fb9` (ancestor of linux-next, 0 ahead).
- **Worker drain**: claimed and completed `policy/no-python-runtime-scripts` final slice. Ported the final two Python-backed scripts — `fetch-cheatsheet-source.sh` (6 python3 sites) and `regenerate-cheatsheet-index.sh` (1 python3 site) — into `tillandsias-policy` as subcommands, reducing shell scripts to thin compile+exec wrappers. `scripts/check-no-python-scripts.sh` passes successfully with exit code 0.
- **Integration/runtime**: no sibling branch is ahead of linux-next.
- **Release/e2e freshness**: no release warranted from this tooling-only cycle.
- **E2E gates**: not run this cycle (worker slice).
- **New findings**: none.

## Loop 2026-06-20T06:00Z (worker drain — nanoclawv2 slice)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration on mutable Linux (Fedora 44): worker drain plus coordination audit.
- **Startup**: began clean on `linux-next` at `f871f8b2`; no tracked or untracked worktree changes. Host classified as `linux_mutable`.
- **Worker drain**: Claimed `nanoclawv2-orchestration` reclaimable lease. Slice 2 completed: registered nanoclawv2 in Rust image builder (image_specs, image_build_inputs with forge-base dependency, run_init image array). All tests pass, clippy clean. Committed `58996d8f`.
- **Sibling coordination**: no merge needed. `origin/windows-next` and `origin/osx-next` heads checked — both remain ancestors of `origin/linux-next`; drift is 0 commits for both.
- **E2E gates**: skipped. The nanoclawv2 --init registration is additive (image was already buildable via build-image.sh; no runtime crate delta to smoke-test). Latest GitHub release remains `v0.3.260618.2`.
- **Release decision**: deferred. No release-blocking change; VERSION remains `0.3.260619.5`, no `v0.3.260620.*` tag exists.

## Loop 2026-06-18T20:50Z (release-smoke pass)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration release-smoke pass after fetch/worker and sibling audit.
- **Startup**: clean mutable-Linux host on `linux-next`; fetched origin, fast-forwarded from `7bc7b5bb` to `36cd9020`, then pushed forge findings commit `62964f02` and this smoke ledger commit.
- **Sibling heads after fetch**:
  - `main`: `6dfafdf1` (tagged `v0.3.260618.2`).
  - `linux-next`: `36cd9020` at audit start, then `62964f02` after forge proposals.
  - `windows-next`: `e332afb6` (ancestor of linux-next, 0 ahead / 12 behind).
  - `osx-next`: `c7d32fb9` (ancestor of linux-next, 0 ahead / 14 behind).
- **Worker drain**: no implementation packet claimed before the release gate. The latest release was newer than recorded curl-install smoke evidence, so `/smoke-curl-install-and-test-e2e` was prioritized.
- **Integration/runtime**: no sibling branch is ahead of linux-next, and `plan/localwork/runtime-litmus/current` is absent. No full litmus was started.
- **Release/e2e freshness**: GitHub latest release is `v0.3.260618.2`, published 2026-06-18T18:07:14Z at `6dfafdf1`; curl-install smoke now has PASS-with-findings evidence at 2026-06-18T20:50Z.
- **E2E gates**: curl-install gate passed install, destructive reset, empty store verification, fresh init, and prompted OpenCode forge lane. Report: `plan/issues/smoke-e2e-findings-v0.3.260618.2-2026-06-18.md`.
- **New findings**: in-forge `/forge-continuous-enhancement` filed three ready follow-ups: `smoke-finding/forge-ripgrep-missing`, `smoke-finding/forge-marksman-missing`, and `smoke-finding/forge-nix-store-missing`.

## Loop 2026-06-18T23:20Z (worker drain — no-python slice)

- **Cycle type**: meta-orchestration worker drain on mutable Linux.
- **Startup**: clean `linux-next`, in sync with origin (`5613b40e`); fetched
  origin/prune. Siblings: windows-next `e332afb6`, osx-next `c7d32fb9` (both
  ancestors of linux-next); main `6dfafdf1`.
- **Packet claimed + completed**: `policy/no-python-runtime-scripts` —
  `distill-forge-diagnostics.sh` slice. Ported to a `tillandsias-policy
  distill-forge-diagnostics` subcommand; shell reduced to a thin build+exec
  wrapper. 45/45 target/forge-diagnostics logs byte-for-byte parity-verified vs
  the former CPython extractor. clippy/fmt/test/`build.sh --check` green;
  workspace + serde_json consumers re-tested after enabling `preserve_order`.
- **Remaining Python-backed scripts**: 2 — `fetch-cheatsheet-source.sh` (6
  python3 sites, large) and `regenerate-cheatsheet-index.sh` (1 site).
- **Other claimable**: `nanoclawv2-orchestration` (RECLAIMABLE; large
  multi-component build with open architecture questions — needs a task-graph
  decomposition cycle before code).
- **E2E**: not run this cycle (worker slice; left budget for orchestrator).
- **Release**: not warranted from this cycle alone (tooling-only change; no
  shipped-binary behavior change).

## Active Conflicts & Mediation

- Deadlocks: none detected.
- Thrashing/write-write collision: none detected.
- Branch drift: none; both sibling branches are integrated into `linux-next`.
- Wrong-direction progress: none detected.
- High-Velocity Alignment Event: inactive.
- Convergence velocity: positive; all orphaned future intentions are now
  shaped into plan packets.

## Blockers

- **BLOCKER (linux)**: `local-smoke/wasmtime-dnf-migration-failure` blocks the E2E initialization gate on mutable Linux due to missing `wasmtime` package in Fedora minimal 44 repositories.
- **CRITICAL (linux -> macOS)**:
  `enclave/macos-vault-unreachable-via-publish-aarch64`. Current Linux tree
  already has Vault API listener `0.0.0.0:8200` and host CA loading from
  `/tmp/tillandsias-ca/intermediate.crt`; next useful evidence is the aarch64
  VM probe:
  `curl --cacert /tmp/tillandsias-ca/intermediate.crt https://127.0.0.1:8201/v1/sys/health?standbyok=true`.
- **CLAIMED (linux)**: `nanoclawv2-orchestration` is actively leased by
  `linux-tlatoani-big-pickle-20260620T055600Z` until 2026-06-20T09:56Z.
- **READY (cross-host)**: `future-intentions-drain/windows-macos-feature-parity`
  packet now shaped and ready for host-specific work.

## Assignment Board

- **Linux primary**: resolve or precisely block the macOS aarch64 Vault
  reachability packet; fallback to
  `future-intentions-drain/windows-macos-feature-parity` if no VM access is
  available and NanoClawV2 remains actively leased.
- **Windows primary**: keep `windows-next` synchronized and verify the
  cold-provision/headless unit path before optional UX work.
- **macOS primary**: wait on the aarch64 Vault reachability fix/probe, then land
  the orchestrated GitHub Login route and run m8.
- **Coordinator fallback**: keep ACTIVE.md and host queues aligned with the new
  Windows/macOS parity packet.

## Pending Pings

- Need aarch64 VM operator evidence for the Vault published-port probe above.
- Need operator-attended `tillandsias --debug --github-login` validation with a
  fresh/rotated token on current release once the macOS layer-5 blocker is
  resolved.
